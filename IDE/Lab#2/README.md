Laboratory Work Nr. 2
====================

GUI Development
------------

Completed Mandatory Objectives:
--------------------

*	Define 3 virtual tasks that you Simulatron is supposed to control
*	Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls (any child window control mentioned in book Windows Programming ed.5 is considered standard)


Objectives With Points:
----------------------

*	Add 3 non-standard controls (2pt)
*	Create a custom control (not existent in IDE) (2pt)
*	Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions (1pt) ex. on clicking a button a counter should start
*	Create a Reset button. On clicking this button all controls should go to their default state (1pt)
*	Add a GUI test (1pt)
*	Set a breakpoint in your application and check variables values at that moment of time (1pt)
*	Set debug watches that will not stop your application from running but will allow you to check any application's state (ex. a variable value at some point of time, if a function was called, memory usage) (1pt)
*	Create an installable application (1pt)
*	Implemented a text to speach feature (1pt)


The theory of workflow:
--------------------------

For this lab I've used Visual Studio IDE. The non-standart controls are: pop-up, expander and canvas. I've created a simple custom control - it will always display a constant text field. The controls interact with each other: on pushing the radio button a pop-up appears and the sound enables. I've impelmented a reset button and  Also I've added a GUI test, made the app to be installable using the downloaded plugin (and registering on Microsoft's site). Also I've enjoyed the debug tool of VS - it is really cool and intuitive.
