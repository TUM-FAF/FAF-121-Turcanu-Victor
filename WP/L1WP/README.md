------------------------------------------------------

#### Purpose: ####

* Event driven programming (message-oriented)
* Windows API. 
* Windows application development

#### Additional purpose: 

* Version Control Systems (GIT)
* Programming Style Guidelines

## Completed Mandatory Objectives:

* Create a Windows application
* Choose Programming Style Guidelines that you'll follow
* Add 2 buttons to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)

## Completed Objectives with additional points:

* Make elements to fit window on resize **(1 pt)**
* Make elements to interact or change other elements (1 pt for 2 different interactions) **(0-2 pt)**
* Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). **(1 pt)**

## The application creation stepts

For creating this app I've read the chapters that where specified in the task of the lab and also the [www.MSDN.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) website for and advance look and [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/). 

For developing the project, I've used the CodeBlocks IDE. The project can be simply compiled having the ** *.cbp ** file and the resource ** *.cpp **. You should have them both in the same directory. Open the file ** *.cbp ** and compile the project. 

The mockup of the app:

#### Features: ####

*	3 Text fields: 2 text field with default styles, 1 with custom style (font, text color, size)

*	4 Buttons: 1 with default styles, 3 with custom styles (font, text color, text size)

*	By clicking the “Submit” Button the text from “Input Text Box” goes to “Output Text Box”

*	By clicking the “Change Font” Button, the text in “Output Box” updates and changes circularly to one of the four predefined fonts: Tahoma, Courier New, Comic Sans, Bookman Old Style

*	By clicking the “Change Size” Button, the text in “Output Box” updates and changes circularly in size

*	By clicking “Exit” Button the program will terminate execution and the window will be destroyed

*	The window can be resized but it has a minimal dimension

*	The position of the buttons react to the size changes of the window

*	The position and dimensions of the Edit Boxes react to the size changes of the window

*	When clicking on “Close” the window will not be destroyed but a message box will appear above

*	When clicking on “Maximize”, the window will not be maximized but a message box will appear and the position of the window will change randomly

*	When clicking on “Minimize”, the window will not be minimized, but a message box will appear

*	The window can be maximized by typing in input box only the word: “MOVE”
