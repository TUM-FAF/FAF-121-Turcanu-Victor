Window. Window handling. Basic windowâ€™s form elements


#### Purpose: ####

* Event driven programming (message-oriented)
* Windows API. 
* Windows application development

#### Additional purpose: 

* Version Control Systems (GIT)
* Programming Style Guidelines

## Completed Mandatory Objectives:

* Create a Windows application
* Choose Programming Style Guidelines that you'll follow
* Add 2 buttons to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 text elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)

## Completed Objectives with additional points:

* Make elements to fit window on resize **(1 pt)**
* Make elements to interact or change other elements (1 pt for 2 different interactions) **(0-2 pt)**
* Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). **(1 pt)**

## The application creation stepts

For creating this app I've read the chapters that where specified in the task of the lab and also the [www.MSDN.com](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) website for and advance look and [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/). 

For developing the project, I've used the CodeBlocks IDE. The project can be simply compiled having the ** *.cbp ** file and the resource ** *.cpp **.  

The mockup of the app:
![Mockup](./images/drawing.jpg)

1. Two simple text fields with default styles
2. The Input Edit Box
3. The Submit Button. When clicked, a Message Box with the text from the Input box appears. If clicked Yes, it will display the above text in Output Box
4. Output Edit Box
5. Styled text field (font, color, size)
6. Font Button - changes the font of the text in Input and Output Boxes
7. Size Button - changes the size of the text in Input and Output Boxes
8. Color Button - changes the color of the text only of the text from the Input Box 
9. Exit Button - quits the program and distroyes the window
10. When resized, the buttons' and the Edit Boxes' position changes according to the size of the Window
11. If you click Minimize - there will appear a Message Box, but the Window will stay unchanged
12. If you click Maximize - the position of the Window will change randomly and a Message Box will appear 
13. If you click Close - a Message Box will appear, but the Window will stay unchanged

The Window has a minimal size which was set using the [WM_GETMINMAXINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632626(v=vs.85).aspx) message processing. 

The font and the size (which is a parameter of the CreateFont function) are stored in a two dimensional array. The rows represent different fonts, the columns different sizes of the font. 

The color of the text of the Input Edit Box is changed accordng to [WM_CTLCOLOREDIT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb761691(v=vs.85).aspx) message processing. This message allows us to change the color only for the Edit Boxes which don't have the style **ES_READONLY**. That's why processing this message we can't change the color of the text of the Output Edit Box.

If you type the word 'MOVE' then the window will be Maximized.
