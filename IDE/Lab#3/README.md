------------------------

Unfortunatelly I don't have a smartphone so it was quite complicated and challenging for me to perform. I don't any hardware device to dbug and the emulator for Android was very slow and crashed when lounched even when my app was not installed on it. Anyway Imanaged to send and debug it remotely. 

My app is a simple task list and has 3 buttons on main page. One for adding a task, one for removing and the third one for displaying a pop-up window. There is an input field for task input and below there is the list view with older tasks. On the background a cool music is playing. It can be paused in about window in pop-up.
