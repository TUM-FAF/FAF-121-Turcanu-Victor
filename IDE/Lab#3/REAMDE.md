IDE Laboratory Work #3
==========================

Subject
------------------

Mobile Applications Development

Objectives
------------------

* Visual Studio
* Xcode
* Android Studio
* Eclipse
* NetBeans

Mandatory Tasks
----------------------

* Study design guidlines for any mobile OS (Android, iOS, Windows Mobile)
* Create a mobile app and launch it on emulator/simulator. Your app should have at least 3 element (ex. button, textarea, statusbar...) and one action (ex. clicking on a button will trigger a popup)


Objectives with points
-------------------------------
* Install your application on a mobile phone. It should have somewhere your full name (on main screen, in settings...) (2pt)
* Create 3 different views (ex. one with a list of some element, one with some settings and one with application description) (2pt)
* Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)
* Use a hardware device for testing and debugging (1pt)
* Create a responsive layout (1pt)
* _Mention your own tasks that you did and claim points for them (max of 5 pt in total)_


##Theorethical Work:##

It was quite challenging to develope a mobile application first of all because I don't have a smartphone, so I can't eventually test it on hardware, but I managed to do it with the help of my classmates who have smartphones. I chose to develop an **Android Application** because I want to discover this area more in future. In order to perform this I've used Eclipse IDE, along with JDK and ADK. 

In order to perform this task, there were very useful the links provided by you in the description of the task, but also there arrose some questions and [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) helped me a lot. I used a hardware debugging, because the emulator on my laptop crashed each time when I opened it, even without my app in it. 

My application is basically a todo list but with some music displayed on background. There is a button for setting a new task and for removing ald old one from the list. Also there is a button wich enables a pop up dialog box in which is described very simple the app. Also the appeared dialog box has two buttons which both pause the background music.
