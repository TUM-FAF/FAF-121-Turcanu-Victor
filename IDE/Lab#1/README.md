##Theoretical Work:##

There are a lot of benefits of working on a remote server via ssh. First of all - using ssh keys it's more secure than simple passwords. Secondly - you have a lot of power over file management and the tasks you can do than using a GUI. Working through a command-line interface it is more useful than through a GUI because is the secodn situation there are a lot of hidden backtracks that you can't use and this creates disconfort. 

I used Vim text editor for editig the text file as well as the code. It has a lot of advantages but also and a lot of disadvantages. The bigest advantage is that it doesn't need a lot of resources in order to run. The disadvantage is the antiintuitive working process. Sometimes it is unpleasant to manage with data, but in the same manner it is fast.

And finally, but not the least important, is the Git VCS. It a very powerful tool wich allows the users to keep the track of their work and data. It diminishes the risk of losing data and offers a great opportunity for users to reuse their data comming back to previous stages of work.


##Practical Work:##

### Connect to a remote server via SSH ###

I tried to connect to the server in modes: first on a Unix based OS (Ubuntu) and the second on Windows (using shell). It wasn't hard on neither of them, but you have to install the shell on Windows. To connect to a remote server via ssh I used the `ssh username@host:port`, where `username` was given and the `host` was the IP address of the remote server.

### Initialize a repository on server, make a file, write your name in it and commit it ###

In order to perform the given task I followed the next steps:
	* `mkdir Turcanu_Victor_FAF_121`, `cd Turcanu_Victor_FAF_121` - create a new directory and enter it
	* `mkdir git`, `cd git`, `git init` - create a new directory git, access it and initialize an empty repository
	* `touch file.txt`, `vim file.txt`, `:i`, `This is my fist file using vim`, ^C, `:wq` - create a new file, access it using vim, write something, close it saving the changes
	* `git add .`, `git commit -m "first commit"` - adding files and committing them

### Connect to server using public key ###
 I copyed the content of the file `id_rsa.pub` from the `.ssh` directory from my local machine to the file `authorized_keys` from the `.ssh` directory on the remote repository. I did it using `clip < .ssh/id_rsa.pub`.


 ### Working with Git ###

 	* Creating new branches and files

 	``` sh

 	git branch branch1
 	git branch branch2
 	git checkout branch1
 	git touch file1
 	git add .
 	git commit -m "branch1: file1"
 	git checkout branch2
 	git touch file2
 	git add .
 	git commit -m "branch2: file2"

 	```

 	* Reset a branch to a previous commit, and back

 	``` sh

 	git reset --hard HEAD^ 	# resets the head of the tree to the previous commitment
 	git reflog
 	# list of commitments and their ids
 	git reset --hard <commit's id>	# here the commit's id is the id of the one before last commit

 	```
 	* Cherry-pick, rebase

 	``` sh

 	git reflog
 	git checkout master
 	git cherry-pick <commit id1>   # commit id1 is now applied to the master branch and commited (as a new commit) in master

 	git checkout -b branchx <commit id1>  # creates a new branch at what commit id1
 	git rebase --onto master <commit id2>   # the result is that commits through id1 to id2 are applied to master

 	```

 	* Creating a VCS alias (Git)

 	``` sh

 	git config --global alias.vic = "commit -m"

 	``` 

 	* Creating a VCS hook 

 	Here I encoutered a little problem on Windows (on Ubuntu it worked perfectly), becouse of the path setting, so I decided to make it on Unix anyway, listening to a piece of advice from my colegue Andrei Istratii, and made it on the Windows but using the shell and conecting to the remote server which was offered to us at the lab. 

 	``` sh

 	

 	```




 	Hihlighting the code in vim
