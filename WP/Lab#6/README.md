The theory of workflow:
-----------------------------

I've chose to do the application from the second laboratory work on IDE, because there I've used WPF in order to perform the tasks. WPF is quite easy to use and a lot of interactions can be done without C#. But this wasn't my purpose, I've got accostumed to the .net Framewok and it was a nice experience for me.
